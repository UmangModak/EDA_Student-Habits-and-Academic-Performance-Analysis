# EDA_Student-Habits-and-Academic-Performance-Analysis
A data analysis project exploring how students’ habits—such as study time, sleep patterns, extracurricular activities, and lifestyle choices—impact their academic performance.

Introduction

This project explores the relationship between students’ daily habits and their academic performance. By analyzing factors such as study hours, sleep duration, extracurricular activities, and lifestyle choices, the project aims to uncover patterns that influence grades and overall academic success.

📂 Dataset
